// Why do we need do all of these serial programming at all
// why we don't do all of these calculation in parallel

Read all array's elements to memory - O(1)
Caculate divisible_by_3 / by_5 - O(1)
Get the boolean Math(&&) and branching - O(1)   // easy to draw logic gates ?
Print the result - trouble  here, may need locking/lazy eval 
                   but O(1) is still possible
